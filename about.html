                    writing MAlkebsi, I wrote it like MKebsi since in
                    Arabic, the word "AL" have the same usage of
                    the definite article "The". As a family name, Arabic
                    people used to make their family names definite
                    to have a great respect among the others. After
                    all, I deleted the "The" and wrote it everywhere and
                    used it as a trademark or logo.

                    at Harvard, but it is just a course. Expeditiousness was
                    the main thing I thought of while working on any single

                    Working at Freelancer, UpWork, Envato Elements and

                    specialist working with websites, video games, android
                    apps and windows/mac softwares. I think that seems 
                    too much, but once I dream, I make it limitless so that it
                    can be achieved.

                    The biggest attainment I have done was being a certified

                    The Open University, SEMRush Academy, Hasso Plattner

                    for a Bachelor degree from University of London, and I want 
                    to have some Micro Bachelors from Edx and its partners. I am

                <p data-aos="fade-right">
                    The story started long ago, in 2018. I was about to start
                    the high school. It was the summer vacation, and that 
                    deep question came to my mind. "What am I going to 
                    study at college?". It was a real hard question, but I have 
                    seen that I am already in love with the technology, so I 
                    started search about the best tech jobs in the world. 
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p data-aos="fade-right">
                    One of them was making video games, and I loved it. I 
                    started learning it, but it was extremely difficult for me 
                    since I didn't know English at all and the Arabic resources 
                    were too limited. 
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p data-aos="fade-right">
                    In 2019's summer vacation, after one year, I started 
                    explaining my enthusiasm in tech to one of my friends 
                    who was studying it at college, and I told him that games 
                    programming was hard. He gave me some Arabic pdfs
                    on programming essentials and websites development.
                    I really loved how a person can do something like a 
                    website with only code. 
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p data-aos="fade-right">
                    Once I started, my mom decided that me and my brother
                    should start learning English. This was weird but also the 
                    best decisions my mom have ever made form me. Three 
                    months, and I was able to write and read in English, so I
                    started searching in English. 
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p data-aos="fade-right">
                    Then I joined some college students who have 
                    encouraged their professor to teach them some special 
                    courses in programming. We used W3Schools as the 
                    main reference for that. It was one of the most pleasant
                    moments in my life because the challenges were so 
                    exciting, and we were all full of amazing momentum. 
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p data-aos="fade-right">
                    After all, this was the final project at that course, but their 
                    were no particles in it, no glitches and no illustrations. I 
                    only made a very simple, water effect. Lastly, I updated it 
                    to make it as my personal website and published it to the 
                    public.

                <p data-aos="fade-right">
                    Most of the time, I start with a plan and try to keep going
                    with the actual plan. First of all, I usually make a small
                    brainstorming for the resources available, 
                    interdependencies, rabbit holes (the things that may trap
                    me), technologies, effects, styles and the main features

                    After that, I also start with a simple rough draft, and
                    then try to git the style and make a final prototype. 
                    This is how I start and end making a web project, but
                    this one have skipped these to processes since it was
                    initially made long ago.

                    Then, after having a clear view of what am I going to do,
                    I head to work in the client-side (e.i. designing, what a 
                    user can see). After having done with the client-side, I
                    start programming and data managing. This would, as
                    I hope, be the best process i could start and end with.

                    All this was just a friendly talk. I did all this and wrote too
                    much because I don't want someone to enter my "About
                    Page" and doesn't find what he was looking for. I felt as I
                    am filling a FAQs page and not anything more, but I hope
                    that it tells you who am I, and why I made this. If there is 
                    something  you want to know about, feel free to <a href="contact.html">
                    contact me</a> any time.
