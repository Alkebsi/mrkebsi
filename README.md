This project was mainly as a personal portfolio for myself, but now it is open for every excited designer. You can freely use this project for any purpose. The limitations are:
- You can't take it as it is and sell,
- You can't use the logos as yours
- You can't use the drownings unless you purchase the template form [Envato GraphicRiver](https://graphicriver.net/item/collection-of-landing-page-templates/23961594)

## Installation
This project used CSS and Javascript, so just clone the project to your hard disk, and that is it.

## Technologies & Styles Used
- Float & Grid Layouts
- Glassmorphism (backdrop-filter)
- Blend Modes
- SVG Filters
- JS Animation (Mostly)
- One [CSS File](link to the color.css file) Coloring (Not Every Color but Most, Easily Changeable)
- Forced dynamics (Like the email form, filters in every page, particles, quotes...etc)
- Only Clean Javascript, CSS3 and HTML5
- No React, Node.js, jQuary, Bootstrap...etc
- No PHP, ASP, SQL...etc. Only static website

## Contributions
Please, this is a very personal website, so if you are willing to help me, I would be really glad. First of all, not to let you work hard hours for me and, at the end, I reject your pull request, contact me first and then we will discuss. Thanks for everyone who would spend even a minute fixing anything that was done wrong, like a typo. Contribution is appreciated by all means.

## Credits 
Also I want, even not forced, to mention some great resources I used. They were one of the reasons why my project succeeded.

-  **Special Thanks:** I want to give a special thank to the guys at codepen.io all, and a thank from my hurt to [Blaz Kemperle](https://codepen.io/blazicke), [Smashing Magazine](https://codepen.io/smashingmag) and [Dirk Weber](https://codepen.io/DirkWeber) since their pens really helped me.
