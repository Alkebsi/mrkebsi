                        This template is one of the projects that was
                        built to be published or sold in Envato Themeforest.
                        I worked hard on it, and because of some internet 
                        issues, I was unable to upload it. The Internet stopped
                        me for a while, but I later decided to make it free and
                        open source project. I saw many things that can be
                        edited and updated, so I will work on it soon, and I
                        will try to make it free, God willing.

                        Finally, this was a project that I can call a Professional 
                        one since it was meant to be published in Envato 
                        Themeforest. Also it is not released till now since I had
                        to build other projects. It Is coming Soon...

                    <h2>Henkel - HTML Landing Page</h2>
                    <p>
                        Once upon a time, I felt that only building projects
                        that are purposeless is going to cost me a lot of
                        time for a small thing in my portfolio, so making
                        something for some company may made an impact.
                        I went to LinkedIn Company Directory and clicked
                        on of the links. It was Henkel. I didn't actually know
                        what Henkel is, but I decided to build something with
                        that name.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        I made a small challenge to motivate me that I would
                        build the website from the information gathered from
                        outside the main website since I wanted to compare 
                        my final result with Henkel's actual site. I went on and
                        took my info from LinkedIn, Facebook and Wikipedia. 
                        Lastly, I end up with a, as I can express it, a masterpiece.
                        It is not that legendary, but better that Henkel's Landing
                        Page. That was the challenge.

                        In advance, I flexed so much on this project while it may
                        seem usual for some people, but I have seen some surprised
                        faces before. Anyhow, the point is that I think I would be able
                        to make some changes and then upload it online. Up till now,
                        this website you are viewing is the first thing I have 
                        professionally uploaded online, so any other thing is secondary.

                    <h2>HeadBanging - A Strange Web Page</h2>
                    <p>
                        Day after day, studying only was a boring process, and
                        I believed that using what I have learned so far would
                        make something even I didn't know what is it for! I was
                        only a student, but I wanted to do something to impress
                        my friends, and the idea of HeadBanging come to me. A
                        simple website with some head banging heavy metal music
                        in the background. 
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to make the music rase high and have some
                        special effects once a strong beat hits or when the 
                        pattern of the song changes. At the time I was just a
                        beginner, this idea was a real challenge and fascinating,
                        too. However, I wasn't able to have all the effects done 
                        especially working with Web Audio API.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        After a week of completing everything with no audio
                        effects, I decided to have an advice from my teacher,
                        and that was a mistake. He said that what I have already
                        done super amazing, fantastic...bla bla, and he showed
                        it to my friends (who were actually college students) 
                        flexing with it since I was the only high school student 
                        at the class. After all, he ignored my request and ruined
                        everything! Yet, I made it, but also I haven't upload it. I may
                        have another additional ideas in the coming days
                    </p>

                    <h2>SiZillion - A Platform for Web Responsiveness Testing</h2>
                    <p>
                        In 2019, I was very enthusiastic about being a Websites
                        Developer/Designer, but one of the biggest challenges 
                        in my life started there. I didn't had a laptop at that time.
                        I managed, after great difficulties, to code using my mobile
                        phone. At a time, I remembered that I had a small document
                        that was able to test the width and height of my other 
                        documents. 
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        I searched for it and developed it, actually still developing
                        it, to something more sophisticated and neatly designed.
                        This thing made me keep using my phone in some web
                        apps even after a long professional career. After all, a 
                        mobile is much more flexible than PC, but for some touches
                        and nothing more.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        Being able to test my new document in different devices
                        made even better for me to understand how will my site
                        look like in 32 inches monitor while I have a 12 inches laptop!
                        Having more than 1 functionality, I was able to exploit
                        things that I have never thought of.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I also think of making it open source and help others
                        how had my problem in the old days. I don't know what
                        can I say more, but at least, this is another thing I want to
                        help the community with. Even it's just a simple testing
                        tool, it may help someone somewhere!

                        As programmers life goes, challenges come and we
                        usually compete on new technologies, ideas, trends,
                        codes and styles. Other times, courses require some 
                        kind of coursework that comes simple, but holds weight 
                        for a special tech. All of those things are published
                        to <a href="https://codepen.io/mkebsi">Codepen.io</a>.
                        At <a href="https://github.com/mrkebsi">Github</a>,
                        I only upload the things that are "professional or numerous"
                        as I can call it.

                    you live demos of my work, but I will try to do so soon.

                    I always love to see others give me feedbacks about my work
                    even it was a negative review. At least, contacting me is going
                    to make a change. Thanks you for reaching this point. I really
                    appreciate your time and attention.
